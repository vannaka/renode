What is Renode?
---------------

Renode was created by Antmicro as a virtual development tool for multi-node embedded networks (both wired and wireless) and is intended to enable a scalable workflow for creating effective, tested and secure IoT systems.

With Renode, developing, testing, debugging and simulating unmodified software for IoT devices is fast, cost-effective and reliable.

Supported architectures include:

* ARMv7 and ARMv8 Cortex-A, Cortex-R and Cortex-M
* x86
* RISC-V
* SPARC
* POWER
* Xtensa

Why use Renode?
---------------

Renode was created based on many years of experience with the development of software for embedded systems - both for gateways, on-board computers, as well as sensor nodes and microcontrollers.

Testing and developing physical embedded systems is difficult due to poor reproducibility and lack of insight into the current state of a system, especially in multi-node scenarios.

Renode addresses this issue by letting you run unmodified binaries identical to the ones you would normally flash onto their target hardware on a virtual board or system of boards.

One important aspect of the tool is that it simulates not only CPUs but entire SoCs (e.g., heterogeneous multicore SoCs and various peripherals) as well as the wired or wireless connections between them, allowing users to address complex scenarios and test real production software.

Installation
------------

Using the Linux portable release
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you are a Linux user, the easiest way to use Renode is to download the latest `linux-portable` from `the releases section <https://github.com/renode/renode/releases/latest>`_ and unpack it using::

   mkdir renode_portable
   tar xf  renode-*.linux-portable.tar.gz -C renode_portable --strip-components=1

To use it from any location, enter the created directory and add it to the system path::

   cd renode_portable
   export PATH="`pwd`:$PATH"

Follow the 'Additional Prerequisites' section if you wish to use the Robot framework for testing.
Otherwise, you are ready to go to the 'Running Renode' section.

Installing dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Mono/.NET
~~~~~~~~~

Renode requires Mono >= 5.20 (Linux, macOS) or .NET >= 4.7 (Windows).

.. csv-table::
   :delim: |

   **Linux** | Install the ``mono-complete`` package as per the installation instructions for various Linux distributions, which can be found on `the Mono project website <https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin>`_.
   **macOS** | On macOS, the Mono package can be downloaded directly from `the Mono project website <https://download.mono-project.com/archive/mdk-latest-stable.pkg>`_.
   **Windows** | On Windows 7, download and install `.NET Framework 4.7 <https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime>`_. Windows 10 ships with .NET by default, so no action is required.

Other dependencies (Linux only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Ubuntu 20.04, you can install the remaining dependencies with the following command::

   sudo apt-get install policykit-1 libgtk2.0-0 screen uml-utilities gtk-sharp2 libc6-dev gcc python3 python3-pip

If you are running a different distribution, you will need to install an analogous list of packages using your package manager; note that the package names may differ slightly.

Installing from packages
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Go to `the releases section <https://github.com/renode/renode/releases/latest>`_ of this repository and download the appropriate package for your system.

.. csv-table::
   :delim: |

   **Linux** | Install Renode with your preferred package manager using the provided ``*.deb``, ``*.rpm`` or ``*.pkg.tar.xz`` packages.
   **macOS** | Use the provided ``*.dmg`` as normal. Additionally, to use Renode from the command line on macOS, create appropriate aliases. You can add ``alias renode='mono /Applications/Renode.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/Renode.exe'`` and ``alias renode-test='/Applications/Renode.app/Contents/MacOS/tests/renode-test'`` to your ``.bashrc`` or ``.zshrc`` file, depending on the shell you're using.
   **Windows** | Install Renode from the provided ``*.msi`` file. The installer will allow you to add icons to your Desktop and/or Start Menu and an entry to your PATH.

Additional prerequisites (for Robot framework testing)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To write and run test cases, Renode integrates with the Robot testing framework.
This requires you to install Python 3 (on Windows, you will also need Cygwin - see `the advanced installation instructions <https://renode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/building_from_sources.html#windows>`_) with ``pip`` (note that the relevant package may be called ``python-pip`` or ``python3-pip`` on Linux).

Once you have Python 3 and ``pip``, install some additional modules::

    python3 -m pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

Building from source (advanced)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For information on building Renode from source, see `the documentation <https://renode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/building_from_sources.html>`_.

Nightly packages
++++++++++++++++

Nightly builds of Renode for all systems are available at `builds.renode.io <https://builds.renode.io>`_.
Please note that these packages are not stable releases.

The latest builds are always available as ``renode-latest.*`` packages.

Running Renode
--------------

If you followed the instructions on installing from a package above, you should have a system-wide ``renode`` command that you can use to run the tool::

   renode [flags] [file]

If you built it from source, navigate to the relevant directory and use::

   ./renode [flags] [file]

The optional ``[file]`` argument allows you to provide the path to a script to be run on startup.

The script allows several optional flags, the most useful of which are presented below::

   -d            debug mode (requires prior build in debug configuration) - only available when built from source
   -e COMMAND    execute a command on startup (executed after the [file] argument)
   -p            remove ANSI escape codes (e.g., colors) from the output
   -P PORT       listen on a port for Monitor commands instead of opening a window
   --console     run the Monitor in the console instead of a separate window
   -v            prints the version number
   -h            help & usage

Renode can be run on Windows systems by starting Renode.exe with a similar set of optional flags.

Running Renode in a Docker container
------------------------------------

If you want to run Renode in Docker, you can use a prebuilt image available on Docker Hub.

To start it in interactive mode on Linux, assuming you have installed Docker on your system, run::

   docker run -ti -e DISPLAY -v $XAUTHORITY:/home/developer/.Xauthority --net=host antmicro/renode

This should display the Renode Monitor window.
Alternatively, you can provide your custom command at the end of the above line.

To run the image in console mode without X server passthrough, run::

   docker run -ti antmicro/renode bash

You can add more ``-v`` switches to the command to mount your own directories.

For more information and the underlying Dockerfile, visit the `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/renode/renode-docker>`_.
